----------Difference between Linked List and Array------------
-Element of linked list are independent objects
-In array we can only delete the value not the cell
-Linked list is variable in size while arrays are fixed in size
-Insertion and removal in linked are very efficient
-In array while Insertion and removal we need to shift many values
-Array are great when it comes to finding items due to indexing O(1)
-In case of linked list if we want to search for any Element we need to loop over each Element O(N)
-Random access- accessing an Element is very efficient in arrays
